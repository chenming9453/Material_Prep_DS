# Leetcode-notes
**Understand the problem first!!!**

1. Two Sum(1)
- **enumerate** to gain index and elements at the same time
- Unlike R, **remove, del, pop** will remove elements of the original list, so avoid using them when you do not want to change the original list

2. Valid Parentheses(20): stack: LIFO <-> queue: FIFO
- unlike R, logics are **True** or **False**
- consider conditions using if/elif

3. Nested List Weight Sum(339): iteration 
- should understand the functions defined to the object first

4.  Maximum Depth of Binary Tree (104):iteration 
- **None** is like NA in R,any number/string cannot be **None**.Use **if xx is not None** to determine

5. 733

 # A/B test
 
 1. When not to use A/B test: if the change is too large, if control/test group cannot be decided only by the change. if the testing time is too long/cost is too high/. if something is missing.
 
 2. A/B test gives you broad and quantitative data
